Simple Garbage Collector on "C" for some virtual mashine (as her a part). Have beed made strategy [Mark and Sweep]. Works with three data types: number, string, object (container for first and second type). Can use as prototype for more hard realisations.  Code containes many comments how create similar programms (on steps) and what going under hood.

Command for compiling with run on linux: `gcc -o gc garbageCollector.c && ./gc`
